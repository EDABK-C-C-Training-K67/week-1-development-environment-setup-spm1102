3. [Biên dịch code C sử dụng g++](https://nguyenvanhieu.vn/bien-dich-code-c-su-dung-gcc/)

These articles will provide you with an introduction to the "Học lập trình C bá đạo" course and essential information about setting up the programming environment for C.

----------------------------

Your task is to complete the following requirements:

1. Install VS Code.
2. Understand what an environment is and why it is necessary to add environment variables.
3. Install and use the gcc compiler (in the instructions, they teach g++ instead).
4. It is essential to compile and run the code using the command line (typing commands in the terminal), without using the Code Runner extension.


## Step 1: Installing VS Code

Install Visual Studio Code by following the official installation instructions for your operating system. Make sure to download the appropriate version for your system.

## Step 2: Understanding Environments and Environment Variables

Take some time to understand the concept of environments and why they are important in software development. Research how environment variables are used to configure and customize the behavior of software applications.

## Step 3: Installing and Using the GCC Compiler

Follow the steps below to install and use the GCC compiler:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.
2. Install the GCC compiler by running the appropriate command for your operating system.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can use the `g++` command to compile C++ code. Your task is to use `gcc` instead.
4. Execute the compiled program.

## Step 4: Compiling and Running Code using the Command Line

To compile and run your code using the command line, follow these steps with `gcc` instead of `g++`:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your C++ source code file is located using the `cd` command.
3. Use the GCC compiler (`g++`) to compile your code.
4. Once the compilation is successful, run the compiled program.

Make sure to test your code with different inputs to verify its correctness.

Remember, it is important to follow these instructions and compile your code using the command line, rather than relying on the Code Runner extension.

Good luck with your task! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
